# 250 species of birds classification Using the VGG16 Pre-trained Model

## Angelos Nikolas

Using the VGG16 Pre-trained model the classification of 250 species of birds is explored. The model is fitted for a limited time and providing almost 90% accuracy, the accuracy could be higher if the training time was increased. Additionaly, a function for classifying any bird is given.
